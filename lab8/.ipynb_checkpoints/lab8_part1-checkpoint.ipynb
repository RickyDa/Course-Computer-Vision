    "ResNet-50 is a deep residual network. The “50” refers to the number of layers it has. It’s a subclass of convolutional neural networks, with ResNet most popularly used for image classification.\n",

    "The main innovation of ResNet is the skip connection. As you know, without adjustments, deep networks often suffer from vanishing gradients, ie: as the model backpropagates, the gradient gets smaller and smaller and the gradients may have less influence on the \n",

    "ResNeXt, by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). The model name, ResNeXt, contains Next. It means the next dimension, on top of the ResNet. This next dimension is called the “cardinality” dimension.hyper-parameter called “cardinality” — the number of independent paths, to provide a new way of adjusting the model capacity. Experiments show that accuracy can be gained more efficiently by increasing the cardinality than by going deeper or wider. \n",

    "Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENets) introduce a building block for CNNs that improves channel interdependencies at almost no computational cost.\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are built upon the convolution operation, which extracts informative features . In order to boost the representational power of a network, we use “Squeeze-and-Excitation”(SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We use them by stacking these blocks together.\n",

    "VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman. It makes the improvement over AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layer, respectively) with multiple 3×3 kernel-sized filters one after another.\n",
    "Due to its depth and number of fully-connected nodes, VGG16 is over 533MB. This makes deploying VGG a tiresome task.VGG16 is used in many deep learning image classification problems;\n",
